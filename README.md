## Pathologically Curious about All Things IT & Cybersecurity

<b>Hello! I'm Jay, a Software Development and Cybersecurity student from Cincinnati. </b>

I'm passionate about several areas of Software Development & Cybersecurity, including:
- Full-stack Web Application Development
- Microservices Architecture
- Application Security
- System Analysis & Design
- Security Automation & Engineering
- Security Architecture & Zero Trust Design
- Security Research & Threat Intelligence

I also spend much of my time working on home networking and infrastructure projects as part of initiatives to understand effective network/security architecture & design principles. I also use this infrastructure to develop and test various applications.

These initiatives are supported by my insatiable curiosity and love for IT, backed by my fundamental belief in human ingenuity: the idea that we must always strive for excellence and take the next steps, simply because we can.

## My Repositories

You'll find most of my active repositories in my organization Labrynth Network. These repos span various areas such as Infrastructure-as-Code, Automation, and Application Development.

For application development or automation-related projects, some of my most commonly used languages are:
- Python
- JavaScript
